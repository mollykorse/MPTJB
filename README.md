Thank you for considering contributing to our project! Here are the steps to make your contributions using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) directly:

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Visit the GitHub page of the project and click "Fork" at the top right to create a fork under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Forked Repository in VS Code**
   - Open VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette, type `Git: Clone`, and enter the URL of your fork. Choose a local directory to clone the repository into.

3. **Switch to the Development Branch**
   - Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+``) and switch to the `dev` branch, our primary branch for development:
     ```
     git checkout dev
     ```
   - If it's your first time checking out the `dev` branch, you may need to fetch it from the origin first:
     ```
     git fetch origin dev:dev
     git checkout dev
     ```

4. **Create Your Feature Branch**
   - Still in the integrated terminal, create and switch to a new branch for your contribution:
     ```
     git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName
     ```
   - Replace `YourFeatureName` with a short but descriptive name of the feature or fix you are contributing.

5. **Make Your Changes**
   - Use VS Code to make your changes. Remember to save your files.

6. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Once you're satisfied with your changes, stage them in VS Code's Source Control panel.
   - Use the commit message box to describe your changes and click the checkmark above to commit. For a detailed message, press `Ctrl+Enter` in the message box.

7. **Push Your Changes**
   - Push your changes by opening the Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type `Git: Push`, and execute the command. If you created a new branch, VS Code might ask you to configure the upstream; accept it.

8. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub, find your new branch, and click "Pull Request" to initiate one against the original repository's `dev` branch. Fill in the details about your changes and submit.
